### Git Diff Review for `GitCommand.java` and `RandomStringUtils.java`

#### File: `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/ab/sdk/infrastructure/git/GitCommand.java`

**Changes:**
- The file has been moved from index `e844af3` to `36e2ca6`.
- The import statement for `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils` has been replaced with an import statement for `com.ab.sdk.types.utils.RandomStringUtils`.

**Review:**

1. **Import Replacement:**
   - The replacement of `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils` with `com.ab.sdk.types.utils.RandomStringUtils` suggests that there might have been a decision to use a custom utility class within the SDK rather than relying on an external library. This could be for reasons such as reducing external dependencies, ensuring version compatibility, or encapsulating utility logic within the SDK.
   - Ensure that the custom `RandomStringUtils` class provides the same functionality and performance as the Apache Commons version. If there are any differences, document them for future reference.

2. **File Renaming and Index Change:**
   - The renaming of the file and the index change do not inherently raise concerns but should be reviewed for the context of the project. Ensure that the file rename aligns with the project's naming conventions and that the change in index does not break any build or deployment processes.

#### File: `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/ab/sdk/types/utils/RandomStringUtils.java`

**Changes:**
- The file has been updated from index `b9dc0d2` to `3f9ac0f`.
- The class now has a public static method `randomNumeric` instead of being a public class.
- The method signature remains the same.

**Review:**

1. **Method Visibility:**
   - The method `randomNumeric` is now public static, which means it can be accessed without instantiating the class. This is a common practice for utility methods.
   - Ensure that the method name clearly communicates its purpose, as `randomNumeric` is descriptive but could be more specific (e.g., `generateRandomNumericString`).

2. **Class Visibility:**
   - The class itself is now public, which is fine for utility classes that are intended to be used across different parts of the application.
   - Ensure that the class name follows the project's naming conventions and that it is consistent with the rest of the SDK's utility classes.

3. **Code Consistency:**
   - The code within the `randomNumeric` method appears to be unchanged, which is good. Ensure that the implementation is correct and efficient for the expected use cases.

In summary, the changes appear to be focused on refactoring and internalizing utility logic. The changes are minor and should not have a significant impact on the application, provided that the internal utility class provides the same functionality as the external one.
